# OpenTraffic Interface
This project explores and documents the opportunities in solving the challenges
proposed in determining, designing and implementing a user interface for the
OpenTraffic simulation suite.

The primary objective of this project is to deliver an interface which is 
usable by parties without a background in software development (e.g.: Civil 
Engineering students who have not written code before should be able to run
a simulation with OpenTraffic).

The structure of the project is as follows:

 - study the interfaces of other simulation tools available
   - evaluate the pros and cons of encountered interfaces
   - determine the profile of the end-user in order to establish acceptable
     interface guidelines
 - explore the open-source toolsets available for building interfaces
 - explore the integration requirements for the interface to the current 
   codebase
